# Olympic Config Syntax Changes

The configs-updated folder contains the updated syntax for the Olympic config files. The changes are as follows:

## Parameter Syntax Changes

The following parameters have been renamed:

- "t" --> "timeLimit"
- "pass_Mark" --> "passMark"

These changes were made to improve clarity and consistency in the configuration files.

Nothing else has been changed and the old configs with the old syntax are still in the repository for use with older builds of AAI (e.g. 3.1.4.exp).
