# Animal-AI

*Animal-Artificial Intelligence*, commonly known as Animal-AI or AAI, serves as a nexus for multi-disciplinary inquiry, aiming to deepen our understanding of cognition in humans, animals, and artificial entities. Its objective is to advance AI research by exploring cognitive abilities and broadening our comprehension of the spectrum of potential minds. AAI is uniquely structured to enable comparative assessments among animals, humans, and artificial intelligences. It encompasses both software engineering and research, maintained as an open-source project to foster collaborative progress.

This repository serves as the primary hub for essential information and activities related to the Animal-AI environment. It is the exclusive source for all past and forthcoming releases of Animal-AI. To facilitate your initiation, the repository includes a collection of introductory Python scripts for engagement with the environment, alongside an extensive library of over 900 tasks featured in the inaugural Animal-AI Olympics competition. The repository also contains a comprehensive documentation of the environment, including a detailed description of the environment's objects and their properties, as well as a guide to designing experiments with the environment from scratch. More advanced tutorials are also found, such as how to train agents in Animal-AI environments. 

_If you wish to contribute to the project, please familiarize yourself with the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) and the [Code of Conduct](codeOfConduct.md) first._ A comprehensive documentation of how Animal-AI works is also available [here](docs/howitallworks.md), where you can understand the inner workings of how the environment is built and how it functions (_csharp_ and _Python_ codebases).

The Animal-AI environment and packages are currently tested on **Windows 11**, **Linux**, and **MacOS**, with **Python 3.9.x** support, but **Python 3.6.x+** has been reported to be working also. **Linux distros** are also working and stable.
