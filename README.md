# Animal-AI

Animal-Artificial Intelligence (Animal-AI) supports interdisciplinary research to help better understand human, animal, and artificial cognition. It aims to support AI research towards unlocking cognitive capabilities and better understanding the space of possible minds. It is designed to facilitate testing across animals, humans, and AI. Animal-AI is an active, open-source software engineering and research project.

## Overview

- **Website:** [here](https://animalai.org/)
- **Unity/C# Source Code:** [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-unity-project)
- **Python Source Code:** [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-package/tree/main/animalai)

This repository serves as the primary hub for essential information and activities related to the Animal-AI environment. It contains a collection of in-depth guides to the environment, as well as an extensive library of 900 tasks featured in the inaugural Animal-AI Olympics competition.

_If you wish to contribute to the project, please familiarize yourself with the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first._ A comprehensive documentation of how Animal-AI works is also available [here](docs/Technical-Overview.md), where you can understand the inner workings of how the environment is built and how it functions (_csharp_ and _Python_ codebases).

The Animal-AI environment and packages are currently tested on **Windows 11**, **Linux**, and **MacOS**, with **Python 3.9.x** support, but **Python 3.6.x+** has been reported to be working also. **Linux distros** are also working and stable.
