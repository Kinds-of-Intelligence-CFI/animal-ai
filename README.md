# Animal-AI

![steampunkFOURcrop](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai/assets/65875290/df798f4a-cb2c-416f-a150-093b9382a621)

Animal Artificial Intelligence, commonly known as Animal-AI or AAI, serves as a nexus for multi-disciplinary inquiry, aiming to deepen our understanding of cognition in humans, animals, and artificial entities. Its objective is to advance AI research by exploring cognitive abilities and broadening our comprehension of the spectrum of potential minds. AAI is uniquely structured to enable comparative assessments among animals, humans, and artificial intelligences. As an active endeavor, it encompasses both software engineering and research, maintained as an open-source project to foster collaborative progress.

- **Unity Source code:** [https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-unity-project](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-unity-project)

This repo contains the AnimalAI environment, some introductory python scripts for interacting with it, as well as the [900 tasks](configs/competition) which were used in the original Animal-AI Olympics competition (and some others for demonstration purposes). Details of the tasks can be found on the [AAI website](http://animalai.org) where they can also be played and competition entries watched.

The environment is built using [Unity ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs) **Release 20-stable (Python version 0.30.0)**. **Unity** (game engine) is the engine used to develop the platform.

The AnimalAI environment and packages are currently tested on **Windows 11**, **Linux**, and **Mac**, with minimum **Python 3.8.x**, but Python 3.6+ has reported to be working also. **Linux distros** are also working and stable.

**The Unity Project** for the environment is available [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-unity-project), which contains the core developmental code that Animal-AI is built on. It's sister repository is [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-package), where the Python API as well as the maintenance of the PyPI Package is located. Please refer to the specific documentation which details how Animal-AI is maintained and developed, as well as to understand the project repository structure.


## Quick Install (please see Release for latest version of Animal-AI)

*see [here](docs/installationGuide.md) for a more detailed installation guide, including information on Python/pip/conda and using the command line during installation*

To get started you will need to:
1. Clone this repo (optional if you are going to contribute to code).
2. **Install the animalai python package** and requirements by running `pip install animalai` in your terminal from the root folder.
3. **Download the latest release of the environment** for your system [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai/releases):

(Old releases can be found [here](docs/oldVersions.md))

Unzip the **entire content** of the archive to the (initially empty) `env` folder. On linux you may have to make the file executable by running `chmod +x env/AnimalAI.x86_64`. Note that the env folder should contain the AnimalAI.exe/.x86_84/.app depending on your system and *any other folders* in the same directory in the zip file.

## Tutorials and Examples

Some example scripts to get started can be found in the `examples` folder. The following docs provide information for some common uses of the environment.

- [Getting started with the environment](docs/quickStart.md)
- [Using the ML-Agents Low-Level API: A hand-coded Braitenberg Vehicle baseline](docs/lowLevelAPI.md)
- [Designing Experiments](docs/configFile.md)
- [Training examples](docs/training.md)

## Manual Control

If you launch the environment directly from the executable or through the `play.py` script it will launch in player mode. Here you can control the agent with the following:

| Keyboard Key  | Action    |
| --- | --- |
| W   | move agent forwards |
| S   | move agent backwards|
| A   | turn agent left     |
| D   | turn agent right    |
| C   | switch camera       |
| R   | reset environment   |
| Q   | quit aplication   |

## Unity ML-Agents

Animal-AI as well as The Animal-AI Olympics is built using [Unity's ML-Agents Toolkit.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)

Further the documentation for [mlagents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) should be consulted if you want to make any changes.

## Version History
- v3.1.3
  - Resolved Spawner Tree Clock and Multiple Arenas cycling issues
  - Enhanced multiple arenas randomization via the randomizeArenas parameter in YAML
    - Adjusted code to handle arenas with negative IDs by converting them to positive
    - Added more robust error-checking for arena ID's and arena cycling
  - Addressed Unity native warning in Training Arena script
  - Rectified the invisibility issue of the Sign Poster game object
  - Conducted unit tests on TrainingArena.cs and ArenaParameters.cs
  - Shortened end-of-episode notification to 2.5 seconds; also added visual elements of paired reinforcing cues such as colours and short GIFs for better visual understanding for the 'user'
  - Undertook minor Unity script optimizations
- v3.1.2
  - Implemented hot fix for an undiscovered and new bug that affected the Spawner Tree
- v3.1.1
  - Introduced a new feature: "End of Episode Notification." When activated, the episode concludes with a notification for the user/player if their cumulative reward meets or exceeds the threshold set in the config file.
  - Fixed bug that affected the Spawner Tree
- v3.1.0
  - Introduced the "Interactive Button" feature, allowing the player/agent to engage with a button that, through a probabilistic algorithm, may generate a reward.
  - Fixed various bugs.
  - "Headless" mode is tested and supported unofficially - can be used for training agents (works with Raycasting).
  - Further performance improvements to overall project.
- v3.0.2
  - Upgraded Mlagents to 2.3.0-exp3 (mlagents python version 0.30.0)
- v3.0.1
  - Added Agent Freezing Parameter, enabling you to freeze the agent for no reward decrement at the start of an episode, while other objects continue to move around.
- v3.0 **Note that due to the changes to controls and graphics agents trained on previous versions might not preform the same**
  - Updated agent handling. The agent now comes to a stop more quickly when not moving forwards or backwards and accelerates slightly faster.
  - Added new objects, spawners, signs, goal types (see [doc](docs/definitionsOfObjects.md)).
  - Added 3 animal skins to the player character.
  - Updated graphics for many objects. Default shading on many previously plain objects make it easier to determine location(s)/velocity.
  - Made the Unity Environment available (see link on main page).
  - Many improvements to documentation and examples.
  - Upgraded to Mlagents 2.1.0-exp.1 (ml-agents python version 0.27.0).
  - Fixed various bugs.
- v2.2.3
  - Now you can specify multiple different arenas in a single yml config file ant the environment will cycle through them each time it resets.
- v2.2.2 
  - Low quality version with improved fps. (will work on further improvments to graphics & fps later).
- v2.2.1
  - Improve UI scaling wrt. screen size.
  - Fixed an issue with cardbox objects spawning at the wrong sizes.
  - Fixed an issue where the environment would time out after the time period even when health > 0 (no longer intended behaviour).
  - Improved Death Zone shader for weird Zone sizes.
- v2.2.0 Health and Basic Scripts.
  - Switched to health-based system (rewards remain the same).
  - Updated overlay in play mode.
  - Allow 3D hot zones and death zones and make them 3D by default in old configs.
