### IMPORTANT! READ BEFORE USE! ###

# This YAML file contains every object in the arena that is spawnable. 
# Each object has it's own properties such as name, position, rotation, size, and color, as well as their default values.
# You can use this file to see how to define each and every object in the arena. 
# Simply copy the object you want to use and paste it into your own YAML file, either changing the default values or leaving them as they are.

!ArenaConfig
arenas:
  0: !Arena
    t: 250 # The time limit for the arena in seconds. In other words, the time limit for the agent to complete the task (the arena resets after this time).
    - !Item
      name: Agent # Note that the agent will always be spawned first regardless of its position in the configuration.
      positions: 
      - !Vector3 {x: 20, y: 0, z: 15} # The position of the item. This is a Vector3 object with x, y, and z coordinates. Leave values for random spawning.
      rotations: [0] # The rotations of the items. It can be in any angle but default is 0 degrees.

# IMMOVABLE OBJECTS (Note: RAMP is immovable but has a special tag of "ramp" for the agent to detect).
