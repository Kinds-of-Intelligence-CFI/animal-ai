### IMPORTANT! ###
# This YAML file contains every object in the arena that is spawnable. 
# Each object has it's own properties such as name, position, rotation, size, and color, as well as their default values.
# You can use this file to see how to define each and every object in the arena. 
# Simply copy the object you want to use and paste it into your own YAML file, either changing the default values or leaving them as they are.

# VALANCED REWARDS SPAWNERS/DISPENSERS

### ATTENTION! READ BEFORE USE! ###
# A special note on the SpawnerButton: The SpawnerButton is defined uniquely in the arena with the major difference being that each SpawnerButton can be used to define a single instance of the object.
# For example, for other objects you can define multiple instances of the object by simply adding more positions, rotations, sizes, etc. However, for the SpawnerButton, you can only define one instance of the object. 
# Therefore, if you want to have multiple SpawnerButtons in the arena, you will need to define each SpawnerButton separately.
