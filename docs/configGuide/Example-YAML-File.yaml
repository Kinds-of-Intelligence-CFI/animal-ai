### IMPORTANT NEWS ###
# As of AAI v4.1.0, the parameters "t" and "pass_mark" have been deprecated (name change). Replace them with "timeLimit" and "passMark" respectively.
# ... You may still use the older parameter names in AAI builds v4.0.0 and below.

!ArenaConfig
arenas:
  0: !Arena # The number here is the arena ID. It must be unique.
    timeLimit: 100 # The time limit for the arena in seconds. 
    passMark: 0 # The pass mark for the arena. This is the minimum score required to pass the arena.
    items: # The items that will be spawned in the arena.
    - !Item # The item type. This can be any item type defined in the items section of the config file.
      name: Wall # The name of the item type. This must match the name of an item type defined in the items section of the config file.
      positions:  # The positions of the items. The number of positions must match the number of rotations and sizes.
      - !Vector3 {x: 21, y: 0, z: 10} # The position of the item. This is a Vector3 object with x, y, and z coordinates.
      rotations: [0] # The rotations of the items. It can be in any angle but default is 0 degrees.
      sizes: # The sizes of the items. You can scale the items by changing the sizes in each dimension.
