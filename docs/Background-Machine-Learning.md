# Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts

This document aims to provide an accessible overview of Machine Learning (ML) for those new to the field, particularly users of the ML-Agents Toolkit. While we won't cover machine learning exhaustively, we'll touch upon its key aspects, as numerous comprehensive resources are available online.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, is about teaching computers to learn patterns from data. It encompasses three primary types of algorithms: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each learning from different data types.

## Types of Machine Learning Algorithms

### Unsupervised Learning

[Unsupervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) involves discovering patterns in data without predefined labels. For instance, in a gaming context, it could mean categorizing players based on engagement levels to tailor specific interactions, like beta testing invitations for highly engaged players or tutorial suggestions for less engaged ones. This method is particularly useful when labels are costly or difficult to obtain.

### Supervised Learning

[Supervised Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) goes beyond grouping, aiming to learn a direct mapping from data to its corresponding category. For example, predicting player churn in games could involve analyzing historical data with known outcomes (churned or not) and using this to predict future player behavior. This approach requires a labeled dataset, where each data point is tagged with the correct outcome.

### Reinforcement Learning

[Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is about training agents to make a sequence of decisions. By continuously interacting with their environment, these agents learn to achieve a goal or maximize some notion of cumulative reward. This learning type is exemplified by scenarios like training a firefighting robot, where the robot must learn to extinguish fires effectively through trial and error, guided by rewards.

## Deep Learning in Machine Learning

[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is a subset of machine learning algorithms known for learning complex functions from large datasets. It's particularly effective in reinforcement learning with extensive simulation data, like those generated in Unity environments. Deep learning algorithms form the backbone of many ML-Agents Toolkit algorithms, leveraging libraries like [PyTorch](Background-PyTorch.md).

## Training and Inference in ML

All ML branches involve a training phase, where the model is built using provided data, and an inference phase, where the model is applied to new data. Whether it's clustering players in unsupervised learning, predicting churn in supervised learning, or learning optimal policies in reinforcement learning, these phases are crucial.

## Conclusion

Machine Learning's diverse algorithms and applications make it a fascinating and impactful field. Understanding its core concepts is essential for anyone looking to explore AI or utilize tools like the ML-Agents Toolkit for game development and beyond.
