# Training

We expect everyone will have a different setup for training agents. Here you can find two ways to wrap or use the environment as a standard reinforcement learning task. You can use a gym wrapper to wrap the environment for use with your favourite deep learning library. You can also use Unity ml-agents custom training scripts directly.

## gymwrapper.py

The example script `gymwrapper.py` shows a simple way to run an AnimalAI task using stable baselines 3. To run this you will also need to install stable-baselines3.

## trainaai.py

The example script `trainaai.py` shows how to run ml-agents training. Documentation for this can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Training-ML-Agents.md).
