# Olympic Configs Archive

These  configs can be used on AAI builds below 4.0.0. This is because AAI builds 4.0.0 and above use a different config syntax. See the configs-updated folder for the new syntax, making these configs incompatible.

If you wish to use these configs on AAI builds 4.0.0 and above, you can use the updated configs in the configs-updated folder.

 For more information, see changelog for a list of changes.
