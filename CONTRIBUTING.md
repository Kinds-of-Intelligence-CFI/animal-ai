# How to Contribute to Animal-AI

## 1. Fork the repository
Fork the respective Animal-AI 'sister' repositories (Unity/C# and/or Ml-agents/Python) by clicking on the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repositories, located here: [Unity](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-unity-project), and [Python](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai-package).

## 2. Set up your development environment
Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git. Install the necessary dependencies (pip install animalai) and follow the instructions provided in the documentation to set up your development environment properly. Create a new branch for your changes and start working on your contribution.

## 3. Choose an issue or feature
Browse the project's issue tracker or discussions to find an open issue or feature that you would like to contribute to. Please note that Animal-AI has a de-centralized project structure currently, and all issues/bugs/technical developments are to be submitted to their respective repositories. If you can't find an issue or feature that interests you, create a new one and discuss it with the project maintainers. Note that any new feature is to be submitted to the main repository [here](https://github.com/Kinds-of-Intelligence-CFI/animal-ai).

## 4. Make your changes
Create a new branch for your changes based on the main branch of the respective Animal-AI repository, either Unity or Python. Implement your code changes or add new features as necessary. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.

* Example: Let's say you want to add support for a new type of reward in the Animal-AI environment. You should make your changes on the Unity codebase (and Python codebase if your modifications affect how the Python API behaves). You can create a new branch named feature/reward-function to implement this feature and make your changes.

## 5. Test your changes
Run the appropriate tests to ensure your changes work as intended. If necessary, add new tests to cover your code and verify that it doesn't introduce regressions. We have Csharp and Python specific tests for Animal-AI. You should run the tests for the programming language you are using appropriately.

* Example: For the reward function feature, you would write tests to check different scenarios and expected outcomes of the new reward function. Animal-AI is a complex multi-disciplinary project, with a strong emphasis on game development, which requires more extensive testing on average.

## 6. Submit a pull request
Push your branch to your forked repository and submit a pull request (PR) to the respective Animal-AI repository. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes, explaining the problem you solved or the feature you added. Include any relevant links or references that would help the project maintainers review your changes.

## 7. Respond to feedback
Be responsive to any feedback or comments provided by the project maintainers. Address the feedback by making necessary revisions to your code and continue the discussion if required.

## 8. Code review
The Animal-AI project requires code reviewers to review your code before merging to main. Address any issues flagged by the reviewer and actively participate in the code review process by addressing comments from reviewers.

## 9. Merge your changes
Once your pull request has been approved and meets all the project's requirements, one of the maintainers will merge your changes into the main repository and provide feedback to you. 

We are grateful for your contribution to the Animal-AI project.

**Remember to always adhere to the project's code of conduct, be respectful, and follow any specific contribution guidelines provided by the Animal-AI project. Happy contributing!**
